# Setting the beggining value from which 
#Python will start to add 
#numbers in the range from 0 up to x+1, to zero

for x in range(0,(x + 1)):
# (x + 1) - because the "range" function does not
# include the last number

  sum = sum + x
# sum is set to zero, the range is from 0 to x+1
# which means the sum value will change every time
# the "for" statement loops, 
# i.e. sum = sum(0)+x(in the range from 0 to (x+1))
# now the new value of sum = 1, then 2, then 3
# and so on up to x+1

print (sum)
# prints the final value of sum
